**KDR 444 (SRBR 444)**
* KDR 444 is a license-free set of UHF radio channels mainly active in Sweden and Norway. KDR is similar to FRS, PMR 446, or UHF CB and the potential distance range is about the same. KDR 444 also known as SRBR 444.

**PMR 446**
* This is the primary PMR channel set worldwide. It is for NFM (Narrowband FM) simplex, similar to FRS. Coincidentally, the channels are within part of the UHF ham band in USA/Canada. Coincidentally, the PMR3 channel (446.03125 MHz PMR Survivalist Channel) is equivalent, within about 1 kHz, to the USA/Canada Ham UHF survivalist channel 446.030 MHz FM Simplex.

**Jaktradio (Hunting Radio)**
* Jaktradio (Hunting Radio) is a popular license-free group of VHF high-band radio channels very active in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. It is similar to Freenet. The potential distance range with about 4  or 5 Watts FM simplex is about the same as Freenet, Marine VHF, or MURS. Inexpensive HTs (similar in form to PMR) are widely available. Some HTs are configurable for Norway, Sweden, and Denmark channels; other HTs may have only a one- or 2-country channel set. When all the jakt channels listed below are programmed into a conventional dual-band VHF HT or mobile radio, it enables communication with any VHF high-band jaktradio.
